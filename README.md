# Online-college-voting-system
This project is a web application to run voting system in online mode.
This uses html code for web application and javascript code for server.This project is runned within local host.
And about this project here the user has to cast their vote to the participant and there is admin who will be monitoring the whole system and check the results.
The voter has to enter their credentials and has to enter the otp that has been sent to his valid gmail.
And admin has to enter his login credentials to check the voting results.
There are flaws in this system like one can cast other votes by bypassing otp and that can be removed by adding some more hardware components to it for face recognition and the facial data is taken from the college database for comparing.
